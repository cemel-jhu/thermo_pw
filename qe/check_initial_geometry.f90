SUBROUTINE check_initial_geometry(auxdyn)
  !-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  !
  ! This routine checks the initial status of the phonon run and sets
  ! the variables that control the run, dealing with the image
  ! and GRID parallelization features of the phonon code.
  ! 
  ! The size of the grid is determined by the following variables:
  ! nqs : the number of q points
  ! x_q : the coordinates of the q points
  !
  ! nfs : the number of imaginary frequencies
  ! fiu : which frequencies 
  !
  ! The flags that control which tensors to calculate
  !
  ! In a recover calculation the q grid variables are already known, 
  ! read from file in phq_readin. In a calculation starting from
  ! scratch this routine sets them. The frequencies variables and the
  ! tensors flags are read from input. 
  ! The amount of work to do for each representation of each q
  ! point depends on the size of the representation and the 
  ! order of the small group of q. In a recover calculation
  ! these information are on file, when recover=.false. this
  ! routine writes the modes and their degeneration on files 
  ! and calculates the order of the small group of q. The following
  ! variables are set
  !
  ! irr_iq : for each q point how many irreducible representations
  ! npert_irr_iq : how many perturbation per representation and per q
  ! nsymq_iq : the order of the small group of q for each q
  !
  ! The following variables are set by this routine on the basis of
  ! start_irr, last_irr, start_iq, last_iq, OR of modenum, OR of ifat and 
  ! atomo:
  !
  ! comp_iq : =.TRUE. if the q point is calculated in this run
  ! comp_irr_iq : =.TRUE. if the representation is calculated in this run
  ! comp_iu : =.TRUE. if this frequency is calculated in this run
  !                   NB: start_iu, last_iu is not yet programmed
  ! 
  ! After knowing this info the routine divides the total work among
  ! the images (when nimage > 1) INDEPENDENTLY of what has been already
  ! calculated and is available on file.
  !
  ! Then, when recover=.true., the routine looks on files for pieces
  ! already calculated and sets the array
  !
  ! done_irr_iq : =.TRUE. if the representation has been already calculated
  ! done_iq : =.TRUE. if the q point has been already calculated
  ! done_iu : =.TRUE. if already calculated
  ! done_bands_iq : .TRUE. if the bands for the q point are on file.
  !
  ! If recover=.false. all these array are initialized to .false.
