The examples in this directory are those of the QE distribution that are
supposed to run also with thermo_pw. These examples are used to check 
that all the QE functionalities are not broken by thermo_pw. Moreover 
this directory contains a set of examples needed to check the additional
features of thermo_pw not yet exported in QE.

Inside each example a reference directory contains the correct output.


Please note that some PPs are not downloadable from the QE website
so you need to update the variable PSEUDO_DIR in the environment_variables
file to point to your pslibrary directory 
(see https://dalcorso.github.io/pslibrary).

Available examples:

ph_example01 : phonon dispersion of carbon with US-PP, Ni with US-PP and pbe

ph_example02 : phonon dispersions of AlAs with norm-conserving PPs

ph_example06 : phonon dispersions of Pt with fully relativistic US-PPs

ph_example07 : phonon dispersions of Ni with fully relativistic US-PPs

ph_example08 : phonon dispersions of carbon with PAW-PP, Ni with PAW-PP and pbe

ph_example11 : phonon dispersions of Pt with fully relativistic PAW-PPs.
